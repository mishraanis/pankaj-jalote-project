                    Higher education in India has grown tremendously. However,
                    much remains to be done on the quality of research and its
                    application for practical problems. The author has gone into the
                    fact sheet and challenges that lie ahead for building world-class
                    research universities. This book comes at an appropriate time

                    Jayant V. Narlikar once stated, ‘Just as a teacher who does not
                    add to his knowledge through research becomes stale, so can a
                    researcher devoid of teaching experience become sterile.’ A potent
